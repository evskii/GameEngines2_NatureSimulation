# GameEngines2_NatureSimulation
A nature simulation created for my Game Engines 2 module

My Plan:
A nature simulation in which animals and the environment are generated when the game loads. I want to split the level generation up into biomes, where each biome has a few animals in it, each with their own tendencies. There will be predators and prey that need feeding, so the prey will feed on fauna and congregate in areas of interest to them (oasis' and forests where they can find plants to eat) and the predators will seek them out. Prey will flee when being chased by predators. 
The final submission will be a Planet Earth style video where you get a look at different types of animals and the camera will follow them around to see what they do during the simulation.
